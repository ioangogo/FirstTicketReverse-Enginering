# First ticket reverse
In this small project i will be attempting to work out how the new QR code tickets encode some of their data and to see if there is any issues with it

# DISCLAIMER
I take no responsiblity for this infomation being used to commit fraud

if it has been there have been failings by the bus driver to check the ticket, the tickets first use have their logo printed on it and have semi visible logo on the paper, If someone has managed to get a hold of this paper(I have the old one after a driver left it in the metro thing, I mainly use it as paper to write notes on) they have failed to keep this paper secure
